<p>This System was developed for making students's tuition process easier.Each Student who decides to enter 
the system has to enter a valid AEM in order to take a free meal.Once that step is done he can choose any of
the foods provided to him based on the monthly menu.The System after a period of time produces a graphical
representation of the students's choices based on their ages.Lastly any recommendation is accepted based on
graph's results in order to improve montlhy meals
