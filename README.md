# Student's Tuition App

==== About ====

The application was created to improve the process of selecting a menu for university students

NOTE!! The app only works for the students of UoWM in Kastoria.


==== How it works =====

The student fill the login form with his AEM and the system checks whether the AEM exists on the corresponding database or not. If it does, the student can access a menu of meals that are provided to him for free.If it does not the student has to pay a price respectively in order to select any meal he wants from the menu.In both cases when the user selects the meals he wants to eat, each student's choice is stored in a database system.Finally the App collects all the information that is provied to the system (e.g. gender,age etc..) and creates a graphical representation based on that information. The feedback could be used for researches for the improvement of the menus that are provided to the students.
